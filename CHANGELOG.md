## [1.0.3] - 2025-07-24

### Fixed 
- Only ships where the player is currently on or was last on can be controlled now. Last on only possible if currently not on any ship, i.e in water or on land.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-07-23

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where the rudder had to be clicked once in-game to initialize the mod. The mod now initializes correctly without user interaction.
