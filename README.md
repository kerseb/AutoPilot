# AutoPilot

**AutoPilot** is a simple ship autopilot mod that allows for automated steering.

## 🔧 Features

* Press **`O`** to activate or deactivate the autopilot.
* Press **`K`** to apply a course correction to the **left**.
* Press **`L`** to apply a course correction to the **right**.

## ⚠️ Important

Before using the autopilot, **you must click the rudder once** in-game to initialize the mod correctly. Failing to do so will prevent the autopilot from functioning.

## 📦 Requires

To use this mod, you need the following:

* [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) 
* [SailwindModdingHelper by App24](https://thunderstore.io/c/sailwind/p/App24/SailwindModdingHelper/) 

## 🙏 Credits
Much of the implementation was inspired by the SailInfo mod.
